**_Part 2_**


The text talks about the problems facing web developers in general, such as the inability to make changes to the code, the inability to add new features, the occurrence of a problem after solving another problem. The writer focuses on the good solutions and characteristics of the good developer, such as simplicity, and trying to write the code in the simplest way; Until the new developers understand it, in addition to making the goal to help people and not their frustration; The good developer is the one who uses simplicity and lack of complexity in solving problems, and does not focus on showing its intelligence at the expense of the simplicity of the code. Good work is characterized by simplicity, and bad work is characterized by the complexity that makes it short -term, and does not serve for a long time, while good work is simple and long -term, where it is possible to modify and add it and remains existing and useful.
